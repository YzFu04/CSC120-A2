What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I have never study object-orienting programming and was not familiar to definitions introduced in class either. Things became harder especially my own computer was broken and I have to write code online in replit. I also leanred to accomodate the class since we are expected to devote more time on study and resolve problems after class. Overall, with the first trial, I think I am getting used to how the class and will able to handle my homework.
